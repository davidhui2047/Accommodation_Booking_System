Booking Process
Once a client finds the accommodation, he can send a booking request to the host. To send a request, the client must register the system first then login to the system for the further process. The client needs a confirming step with the form prior to submit. (check in/out date, the number of guests, the total price.  Once all the details are confirmed, the request is submitted to the host. 
The client can cancel the booking only when a host has not confirmed the booking yet / payment has not been made. The payment only can be processed when the booking is confirmed by the host. 

Once booking is confirmed by the host, the client can process the next step. In the case of ‘rejected’, they can see the reason why the booking request has been rejected by the host. In the case of ‘accepted’, they can process the payment by providing their credit card details and amount they are going to pay and write a review for their stay.

== Review page for client ==

The client can see all the reviews for the accommodation. She can leave her review.  She is allowed to edit or delete ONLY her review(s).
