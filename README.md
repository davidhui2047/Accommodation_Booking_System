# Accommodation_Booking_System
<b>Description:</b> <br> UniTas Pty., Ltd., starts a new online business which connects travellers and accommodation.  The company has now decided to develop online accommodation booking system (ABS) which has multiple accommodation venues with multiple hosts.
<br> The ABS has three different types of user:
<ul>
<li>Client – a traveller who wants to book accommodation</li>
<li>Host – a house owner who provides a minimum of one accommodation for ABS</li>
<li>System Manager – a manager who manages the ABS</li>
</ul>
To use the ABS, both client and host must first register into the system by providing their details including name, e-mail address, mobile phone number, password and the postal address. To be registered as a host, a user provides their ABN number as an additional mandatory information.
